          People always want to take the easy way out. If you can create applications by simply dragging and dropping, without having to write any code, who would want to deal with coding? But can low-code platforms really work perfectly in practice, or are they just toys for beginners?

          Going back to six months ago: When I first started learning ESP32 development, I was too lazy to learn Micropython code, so I hoped there was a low-code tool that could let me see what I was doing and get results immediately—just drag and drop a few times and fill in a few parameters to complete the program. However, things didn't go as planned. After trying several domestic and international low-code tools, I found that in the end, the most efficient way was still to go back to PyCharm and Thonny for development.

          First, low-code tools themselves are black boxes. The generated code has poor readability, making it difficult to understand the underlying logic. Once the functionality does not meet the requirements, debugging is almost impossible, and problem-solving often relies on guesswork. For example, a function that works perfectly in a simulation environment may fail to operate when deployed on an actual SoC, making it very difficult to identify the root cause of the problem.

         <span leaf="">
          Secondly, learning can only be done through examples, but the number of examples may be too limited. If there are no examples for the desired functionality, one has to search extensively elsewhere, which is time-consuming and laborious.

          So after trying it for about 1 or 2 weeks, I still decided to go back to PyCharm and use Tongyi Lingma as my AI coding assistant, which actually proved to be very efficient. Tongyi Lingma claims to have been optimized for IoT code, so I chose it at that time.

          Of course, when using an AI programming assistant, you still need to have a basic understanding of programming. Otherwise, you won't be able to identify issues in the code provided by the AI. Often, the AI assistant can generate code in just two minutes, but you might spend two days debugging a single problem.

          The advantages of Vibe coding over using low-code tools become very apparent in two key areas. First, debugging: when problems occur, you can read the code yourself or continuously hand error messages to an AI assistant for resolution, greatly enhancing controllability. Second, there's no need to search anymore—you can directly tell the AI what you need, and it can continuously generate code. Even some libraries that used to require searching can now be written by the AI itself.

          For example, six months ago, I needed a display driver for a digital tube. The libraries on GitHub weren't ideal—there was only a driver for the common cathode connection method of that specific model, and it was written in C. However, my digital tube was common anode, and I needed a version in MicroPython. Rewriting the driver from the C version to Python using an AI assistant was very convenient. However, the AI assistant couldn't understand the change from common cathode to common anode at first, and I had to manually rewrite that part of the logic myself. If the entire project were built on a low-code platform, it would have been even more challenging, as there would be no ready-made libraries or drivers available, and the only solution would have been to switch hardware.

          Recently, I tried deploying an LLM locally again and encountered similar issues. At first, I was attracted by various articles recommending dify, coze, and n8n on Xiaohongshu, so I started learning on Bilibili. Regarding dify, the problem began from the very start of deploying with Docker, which was quite frustrating. On my Windows machine's WSL environment, there were always some issues when deploying Docker, probably because it couldn't use the proxy from Windows. When deploying inside Docker, it couldn't connect to the server, so I eventually gave up. Then, many people said that n8n was more mature, and after checking, I found that to be true. So I switched to trying n8n instead.

          At first, it was indeed pretty perfect. n8n has more than a few hundred pre-built components for integration, making it easy to connect with AI agents and call LLMs deployed locally via Ollama. I did some simple tests and everything worked well. However, as I delved deeper, problems began to arise: when I tried to read a local file in an actual workflow, it started throwing mysterious errors. Adding the "read file" component led to an error related to date-fns. I sent the error message to AI, and it suggested installing the latest version of date-fns globally. Alright, I did that! It seemed to fix the problem? Then, when I added the "extract from file" component, it kept throwing errors again, this time completely without any direction—total disaster. I reinstalled multiple times and even downloaded example workflows from its official website, but the same errors kept occurring.

          Final realization. I still have to go back to VSCode and let the AI assistant help with programming. It only took one night, and the small tools needed were completed. All the "glue" code, the AI can almost perfectly implement. However, I'm still quite conservative; I usually only use the "smart Q&amp;A" feature of Tongyi Lingma. The code it provides, I usually check myself before copying and pasting. Although the two feature options, "file editing" and "agent," might be more efficient, I'm afraid of messing up the code and ending up with more problems than benefits.

          In contrast, low-code platforms are not actually easy to use. Tools like n8n still require configuring parameters for each component, requiring knowledge of basic JavaScript syntax and JSON. If errors occur, users also need to know how to resolve issues in the installation environment. These fundamental computer skills are unavoidable regardless of the tools or platforms used.

          Then can low-code platforms not be used anymore?

        <section>
         <span leaf="">
          My answer is: Yes, it can still be very useful! First, when you're just starting out, its flowcharts provide a very intuitive understanding of how work processes are organized. They show how a large task can be broken down into smaller components, and these tools have already made very general abstractions. You don't have to figure things out on your own anymore. These abstractions are still very helpful when you're in the "vibe coding" phase, helping you clarify your thoughts.

Second, the large number of examples can inspire learners to create application scenarios that suit their own needs. By considering their own requirements, they can identify which tasks can be automated to greatly improve efficiency. Now that we have this LLM "hammer," looking at what others have already nailed with it is slightly easier than trying to find nails everywhere with just the hammer.

          Final thoughts: Currently, the most effective tools are still VSCode or PyCharm, combined with AI assistants like Cline or Tongyi Lingma. Likewise, the most valuable employees remain those who possess both business experience and thinking, along with a background in computer science knowledge — true multidisciplinary talents.

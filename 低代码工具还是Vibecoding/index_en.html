          People always want to slack off. If they can create applications by dragging and dropping without writing code, who would want to deal with coding? But can low-code platforms truly work perfectly? Or are they just toys for beginners?

          Six months ago: When I first started learning ESP32 development, I was too lazy to learn MicroPython code, so I hoped for some low-code tools that could achieve what-you-see-is-what-you-get—just drag and drop a few times, fill in some parameters, and the program would be ready. However, things didn't go as planned. After trying several low-code tools, both domestic and international, I realized I had to go back to PyCharm and Thonny for development, which turned out to be the most efficient approach.

          First, low-code tools themselves are black boxes. The compiled code has poor readability—you know what it does but not how it works. If a feature fails to meet requirements, debugging is nearly impossible, and solving the problem often relies on guesswork. For example, a function that works perfectly in a simulated environment might fail when running on an actual SoC, making it extremely difficult to pinpoint the issue.

          Secondly, learning is only possible through examples, but the number of available examples might be too limited. For desired functionalities, if there are no examples, one has to search everywhere, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive.

          After working on it for a week or two, I still decided to switch back to PyCharm and use Tongyi Lingma as the AI programming assistant. The efficiency is actually quite high. Tongyi Lingma claims to be optimized for IoT code, which is why I chose it at the time.

          Of course, when using an AI programming assistant, you still need to have a foundation in programming. Otherwise, you won't be able to identify issues in the code provided by the AI. Often, the AI assistant can give you code in just 2 minutes, but debugging a particular problem might take you 2 days.

          Vibe coding offers distinct advantages over using low-code tools, particularly in two key aspects. First is debugging—when issues arise, you can either read the code yourself or continuously feed error messages to an AI assistant for resolution, significantly enhancing control. Second, there's no need for searching; simply articulate your requirements to the AI, and it can generate code continuously. Even certain libraries that previously required searching can now be written from scratch.

          For example, half a year ago, I needed a driver for a seven-segment display. The libraries on GitHub weren’t ideal—only drivers for common-cathode connection methods of that specific model were available, and only in C. Mine was a common-anode display, and I needed a MicroPython version. Using an AI assistant to rewrite the C driver code into Python was very convenient. However, the assistant couldn’t grasp the change from common-cathode to common-anode, so I had to rewrite that logic myself. If the entire project had been on a low-code platform, it would have been a dead end—without ready-made libraries or drivers, the only solution would have been to switch hardware.

          Recently, I tried to deploy an LLM locally and ran into similar issues again. Initially, I was intrigued by various articles on Xiaohongshu recommending Dify, Coze, and N8N, so I started learning about them on Bilibili. The problem with Dify began right from the Docker deployment stage, which was a headache. Due to persistent issues with my Docker setup in the WSL environment on Windows—likely because it couldn’t leverage the proxy settings from Windows—the deployment failed to connect to the server, forcing me to give up. Then, many suggested that N8N is more mature, and after checking it out, I agreed. So, I switched to trying N8N instead.

          At first, everything seemed perfect. n8n has hundreds of ready-made integrated components, can connect to AI Agents, and is very convenient for calling locally deployed LLMs via ollama. Some simple tests worked well. But as I dug deeper... problems started to emerge. When I needed to read local files in actual workflows, it began throwing inexplicable errors. After adding the "read file" component, it started reporting date-fns errors. I fed the error message to an AI, which suggested I globally install the latest version of date-fns. Okay, did that! Seemed fixed? Then I added the "extract from file" component, and it continued to throw errors—this time with no clue at all, a complete disaster. Multiple reinstallations and downloading sample workflows from the official site all resulted in the same errors.

          Finally came to my senses. It's better to just go back to vscode and let the AI assistant help with programming. In just one evening, the small tool I needed was completed. All the "glue" code can be implemented almost perfectly by the AI. However, I'm still quite conservative—I usually only use the "Smart Q&amp;A" feature of Tongyi Lingma. For the code it provides, I typically review it myself before copying and pasting. Although the "File Edit" and "Smart Agent" features might be more efficient, I'm afraid of messing up the code, which could end up doing more harm than good.

          In contrast, low-code platforms are not actually low-barrier to use. Tools like n8n still require configuring various parameters for each component, a basic understanding of JavaScript syntax, and familiarity with JSON. When errors occur, users must also know how to troubleshoot issues within the installation environment. These fundamental computer skills are unavoidable, regardless of the tools or platforms used.

          Can low-code platforms not be used then?

        <section>
         <span leaf="">
          My answer is: Yes, it can still be used and remains highly useful! First, when getting started, its flowchart provides a very intuitive understanding of workflow organization—how a large task is broken down into smaller components. These tools have already created highly versatile abstractions, so there's no need to figure it out from scratch. These abstractions are still incredibly helpful for clarifying your thought process during vibe coding. Second, the abundance of examples can inspire learners to create applications tailored to their own scenarios. By combining these with their specific needs, they can identify which tasks can be automated to significantly boost efficiency. Now that we have the "hammer" of LLMs, seeing what "nails" others have hit is always a bit easier than wandering around with a hammer looking for nails to strike.

          Final thought: Currently, the most effective tools are still VSCode or PyCharm, paired with AI assistants like Cline and Tongyi Lingma. The most valuable employees remain versatile individuals with business experience and mindset, coupled with a professional background in computer science.
